Heres the very first community created FREE model pack from us guys at 3D Game Resources!!

Its a basic crate and barrel with 12 texture variations all contributed by me and the cool guys who hang out on the forums, so thanks go to those of you who contributed!!

Theres basically two 3ds files, barrel01.3ds and crate01.3ds by applying the appropriate texture you get a different look, simple eh?

So as usual there are a few rules for useage of these models:-

1. They can be used free of charge in your games, freeware, commercial, demos etc

2. They cannot be used in other model packs, cd collections, websites or as part of any other packs online or otherwise!!

3. We would really like to see you game etc so drop by the forums and show us your work and hopefully you can remember to include us in your CREDITS ;-)

Thanks,
