You may:

-	Use this in (non-)commercial games.
-	Re-edit the model or the texture. (Would like to see the end result)
-	Sell a game with the model that is used in that game. (Would like to know of this game)

===============

You may not:

-	Sell this model as part of a model-pack, or sell this model alone.
-	Claim as your own.
-	Re-edit the model or texture, and sell it after that.

===============

Would like to have some credits if this is used in a (non-)commercial game.
Not necessary, but would be nice.
If you do put some credits, than i would like it like this:
(Darryl Donohoe - Cheese  Cake.)

Any retexture or re-edit from the model would be highly appreciated
if you posted some screenies on the "free-Bioshock based dude" thread.

The model and texture is created by:	Darryl Donohoe - Cheese  Cake.
Animated by:	Darryl Donohoe - Cheese  Cake.
